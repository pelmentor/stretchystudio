/**
 * undoHistory - pure JS module for snapshot-based undo/redo.
 *
 * No React or Zustand imports - stays free of circular dependencies.
 * projectStore imports pushSnapshot/isBatching/clearHistory from here;
 * the v3 operator registry imports undo/redo for the app.undo / app.redo
 * operators (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z bindings).
 *
 * P1 (2026-05-09) — dropped the structuredClone + JSON.stringify path.
 * The project state is produced by immer and is auto-frozen, so the
 * pushed reference is already an immutable snapshot of the project at
 * that moment. Holding the reference (instead of cloning) is safe AND
 * cheaper — eliminates ~30-50ms structuredClone + ~30-50ms JSON.stringify
 * per push on Hiyori-class projects, and lets snapshots share unmutated
 * subtrees via immer's structural sharing (memory grows by O(diff) per
 * push instead of O(project) per push).
 *
 * Byte budget removed. Without per-snapshot clones, memory growth is
 * dominated by structural-sharing depth — bounded by the actual diff
 * structure of edits, not by raw size. The MAX_HISTORY count cap (50)
 * is the load-bearing limit. Pathological "edit + undo + edit" flows
 * still share unmutated nodes; the tail-risk profile is materially
 * better than with cloned snapshots.
 *
 * `undoStats()` exposes the counters so DevTools / Phase 1
 * status bar / future telemetry can show the user how much memory
 * undo is consuming.

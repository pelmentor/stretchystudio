Each field includes a source tag:
- `[ref]` — observed in Hiyori reference file
- `[re]` — from IDA Pro reverse engineering of Live2DCubismCoreJNI.dll
- `[py-moc3]` — from Ludentes/py-moc3 (verified read+write)
- `[empirical]` — determined experimentally in Session 1–2

---

## Overview

- **Byte order**: Little-endian `[ref][py-moc3]`
- **Alignment**: Sections aligned to 64-byte boundaries `[py-moc3]`
- **Storage model**: Struct-of-arrays — one property for all items of a type stored contiguously `[py-moc3]`
- **Reference file**: `hiyori_pro_t11.moc3` — 444,480 bytes, V4.00 `[ref]`

## Header (64 bytes, offset 0x00)

| Offset | Size | Type    | Value | Description | Source |
|--------|------|---------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 0x00   | 4    | char[4] | "MOC3" | Magic bytes | [ref] |
| 0x04   | 1    | uint8   | 1–5   | Version (see below) | [ref][py-moc3] |
| 0x05   | 1    | uint8   | 0x00  | Big-endian flag (0=LE) | [py-moc3] |
| 0x06   | 58   | —       | 0x00  | Padding | [ref] |

### Version mapping

| Value | Cubism version | Extra sections | Source |
|-------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| 1     | V3.00 | — | [py-moc3] |
| 2     | V3.03 | + quad_transforms (SOT[101]) | [py-moc3] |
| 3     | V4.00 | + quad_transforms | [py-moc3] |
| 4     | V4.02 | + color blend, extended keyforms | [py-moc3] |
| 5     | V5.00 | + additional blend modes | [py-moc3] |

We export **version 3 (V4.00)** — matches Hiyori, works with Ren'Py 8.5 Cubism SDK.

## Binary Layout

```
[0x0000 .. 0x0040)  Header (64 bytes)
[0x0040 .. 0x02C0)  Section Offset Table (SOT): 160 × uint32 (640 bytes)
[0x02C0 .. 0x07C0)  Reserved (runtime pointer array used by SDK after csmReviveMocInPlace)
[0x07C0 .. EOF)     Body: count info, canvas info, then 99 typed-array sections
```

Constants: `HEADER_SIZE=64, SOT_COUNT=160, SOT_SIZE=640, COUNT_INFO_SIZE=128, DEFAULT_OFFSET=1984 (0x7C0)` `[py-moc3]`

## Section Offset Table (SOT)

160 × uint32 at offset 0x40. Each entry is an absolute byte offset from file start.

| SOT Index | Points to | Source |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| 0 | Count Info (at 0x7C0) | [py-moc3] |
| 1 | Canvas Info | [py-moc3] |
| 2–100 | 99 body sections (SECTION_LAYOUT order) | [py-moc3] |
| 101 | V3.03+ quad_transforms section | [py-moc3][empirical] |
| 102+ | V4.02+/V5.00+ additional sections | [re] |

**Critical**: All SOT entries used by the current version must be **non-zero** valid offsets. The SDK rejects files with `SOT[i] == 0` for version-required entries. For V4.00, SOT[0..101] must all be valid. Fill unused entries with the last valid body offset. `[empirical]`

| 15 | UVS | = sum(position_index_counts × 2) | [empirical] |
| 16 | POSITION_INDICES | = sum(vertex_counts) = total flat indices | [empirical] |

## ArtMesh Field Semantics

> **The .moc3 field names are counterintuitive.** This was the primary blocker for Session 1–2. Confirmed via Hiyori analysis. `[empirical]`

| .moc3 field name (misleading) | True meaning | Stretchy Studio source | Evidence |
|-------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|----------|
| `art_mesh.vertex_counts` | **Flat triangle index count** (triangles × 3) | `mesh.triangles.length * 3` | `sum(vc) == counts[16]` in Hiyori |
| `art_mesh.position_index_counts` | **Rendering vertex count** | `mesh.vertices.length` | `uv_begin == cumul(pic×2)` in Hiyori; `csmGetDrawableVertexCounts` returns these |
| `art_mesh.uv_begin_indices` | cumulative(**position_index_counts** × 2) | — | Verified in Hiyori: uv_begin[1] = pic[0]×2 |
| `art_mesh.position_index_begin_indices` | cumulative(**vertex_counts**) | — | Verified in Hiyori: pib[1] = vc[0] |

**Cross-reference formulas:**
```
counts[15] (UVS)             = sum(position_index_counts × 2)  // total UV floats
counts[16] (POSITION_INDICES) = sum(vertex_counts)              // total flat indices
counts[10] (KEYFORM_POSITIONS) = sum(position_index_counts × 2)  // for no-deformer models
```

## SDK Validation Rules

From IDA RE of `Live2DCubismCoreJNI.dll`. See `IDA_SESSIONS.md` for full details.

### `csmHasMocConsistency` — two-phase check
1. **Header validation** (`sub_1800050D0`): all SOT offsets within file bounds
2. **Data validation** (`sub_180004050`): all cross-references consistent (~3000 lines)

### Begin/Count validator quirk `[empirical]`

The SDK's `sub_1800079F0` checks `begin < total` **even when count=0**:
```c
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (begins[i] >= total) return 0;  // FAILS even if counts[i] == 0!
}
```

**Consequences:**
- `mask_begin_indices` cannot be -1 if `DRAWABLE_MASKS=0` → set `DRAWABLE_MASKS=1` with dummy entry `[-1]`
- Null binding bands for parts: `begin` must be `0` (not `N`), because `N >= N` fails
- Any begin/count pair where total=0 will ALWAYS fail → ensure total ≥ 1

### Validated rules

| Check | Rule | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| ID strings | strnlen < 64 (null-terminated) | [re] |
| Bool fields | visibles, enables, repeats: must be 0 or 1 | [re] |
| Parent indices | parent_part in [-1, parts-1], parent_deformer in [-1, deformers-1] | [re] |
| Begin/Count | `begin >= 0 && begin < total && begin + count <= total` | [re][empirical] |
| Warp grid | `vertex_count == (rows+1) * (cols+1)` | [re] |
| Draw order | type 0 → index < art_meshes; type 1 → index < parts | [re] |
| group_indices | must be in [-1, draw_order_groups-1] | [re] |
| V3.03+ quad | must be 0 or 1 | [re] |
| SOT entries | all version-required entries must be non-zero and < file_size | [empirical] |

## Compile-time semantics (cmo3 → moc3)

> **The cmo3 XML doesn't directly carry every moc3 binary value.** Cubism Editor patches several fields on compile based on context (parent type, parameter ordering, etc.). Generating .moc3 directly without these transforms produces files that load but render incorrectly.
>
> Verified by byte-diffing a Cubism Editor "Export For Runtime" against our direct .moc3 emission for the same `.cmo3`. See `scripts/dev-tools/moc3_inspect.py`, `moc3_inspect_rot.py`, `moc3_inspect_warp.py`, `moc3_inspect_mesh.py` for the dumpers used to find these.

### `rotation_deformer_keyform.scales` — frame conversion factor `[empirical]`

The cmo3 XML always stores `scale="1.0"` on every `CRotationDeformerForm`. Cubism Editor patches this on .moc3 compile based on the rotation's parent:

| Parent type | scale value | Why |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Warp deformer (e.g. BodyXWarp) | `1 / canvasMaxDim` (~5.58e-4 for 1792 canvas) | Child sees pivot-relative canvas-pixel offsets; parent expects 0..1; this scales pixels→0..1 |
| Rotation deformer | `1.0` | Both child and parent are pivot-relative pixels; identity |
| Root | `1.0` | Root frame is canvas-px, child frame matches |

`scale = 1.0` everywhere makes rotation-under-warp transitions blow up by `canvasMaxDim×` — children render far off-canvas. This was the root cause of "head/face/arms missing while body renders" in our pre-2026-04-26 runtime moc3.

### `parameter.keyform_binding_begin_indices` — indexes `keyform_bindings`, not `keyform_binding_indices` `[empirical]`

The name reads "begin index in keyform_binding_index" but the field is actually a **binding index** into `keyform_bindings[]` (the deduped binding pool), with `kfb_count` consecutive bindings following.

**Implication**: bindings must be ordered such that all bindings for the same param are **contiguous**, in the same order as the `parameters[]` array. Cubism's compiler does this — the unique-binding pool ends up ordered by owning param. Skipping reordering means `kfb_begin` points to the wrong binding, the SDK routes param values to the wrong target, and nothing animates.

In Cubism's Hiyori shelby export, every active param has `kfb_count = 1` (one binding per param). Inactive params (no objects use them, e.g. ParamMouthForm when there's no mouth shape system) get `kfb_begin = -1, kfb_count = 0`.

### Per-mesh keyform plan must match cubism's branches `[empirical]`

cmo3writer's `CArtMeshSource` emit has 6 mutually-exclusive branches (`hasBakedKeyforms` / `hasEyeVariantCompound` / `hasEyelidClosure` / `hasNeckCornerShapekeys` / `hasEmotionVariantOnly` / `hasBaseFadeOnly` / default). The runtime moc3 must mirror them; ad-hoc fallbacks like "uniform 2-keyform on `ParamOpacity[0,1]` for everything" don't work because Cubism's runtime treats `ParamOpacity` keyform interactions specially (combined with the param's `default=1.0`, mixed-key bindings produce orphan slots that render as half-canvas overlays).

Verified mapping for shelby (cubism native moc3 → matching mesh-binding-plan emit):

| Mesh class | kf_n | Param + keys | Per-keyform vertex positions |
|------------|------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Default (face, ears, hair, neck, body, clothing) | 1 | `ParamOpacity[1.0]` | rest only |
| Variant fade-in (`face.smile`) | 2 | `Param<Suffix>[0,1]` | rest, rest (only opacity differs) |
| Base with variant sibling (non-backdrop) | 2 | `Param<Suffix>[0,1]` | rest, rest (opacity 1→0) |
| Eye closure (eyelash/eyewhite/irides per side) | 2 | `ParamEye{L,R}Open[0,1]` | closed canvas verts, rest |
| Bone-baked (arms/legs) | 5 | `ParamRotation_<bone>[-90,-45,0,45,90]` | per-angle rotated verts |

Eye closure in particular doubles as a fix for the "Assign Clipping of ArtMeshes have keyform problems" load-time warning: clip-mask source meshes (eyewhite_l/r, masking irides) need keyforms at the same param min/max as the masked mesh, otherwise Cubism flags them.

### Binary-diff workflow

When a runtime moc3 loads but renders incorrectly, the fastest path to root cause is:

1. Open the .cmo3 in Cubism Editor and "File → Export For Runtime" — produces a reference .moc3 that's known-good.
2. Run our writer on the same project → reference and ours side by side.
3. `python3 scripts/dev-tools/moc3_inspect.py <path>` for top-level structure (counts, parts, deformers, parameters, art meshes, bindings, bands).
4. `python3 scripts/dev-tools/moc3_inspect_rot.py <path>` for rotation deformer keyform values labelled by deformer id.
5. `python3 scripts/dev-tools/moc3_inspect_warp.py <path> [name-filter]` for warp grid keyform positions.
6. `python3 scripts/dev-tools/moc3_inspect_mesh.py <path> [parent-deformer-filter]` for art-mesh keyform vertex bboxes.

Any field that diverges between the dumps is suspect. Group-by-parent-type before assuming a single fix — e.g. "all rotations under warps differ but rotations under rotations match" pointed straight at the `scales` field.

## py-moc3 Tool Reference

**Install**: `pip install py-moc3` (Python, zero dependencies)

```python
from moc3 import Moc3

moc = Moc3.from_file("model.moc3")
print(moc.summary())
moc["art_mesh.ids"]              # list[str]
moc["art_mesh.vertex_counts"]    # list[int] — FLAT INDEX COUNTS, not vertices!
moc.counts                       # list[int] — mutable count info table
moc.canvas.pixels_per_unit       # float
moc.to_file("modified.moc3")
```

**py-moc3 quirks:**
- `counts` must be updated manually when changing array sizes (not auto-synced)
- Round-trip of existing files is byte-identical (after our quad_transforms fix)
- Can create valid from-scratch models by modifying a known-good base file
